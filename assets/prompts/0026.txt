A person waits at a crosswalk in an urban setting just after sunset. The camera holds on their face and torso as they glance at the traffic light, then shift their bag strap over one shoulder and exhale softly. They wear layered city wear â€” a clean shirt under a tailored jacket, hair kept tidy despite a light breeze. Colored street lights flicker subtly on their skin as cars pass by, while their expression transitions naturally from neutral to faintly amused as they spot something across the street.
