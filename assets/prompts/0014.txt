A person sits beside a large window in a cozy caf√© while city lights blur and shimmer through the steady rain outside. The camera holds a close-up on their face and upper body, following as they switch postures with quick, expressive gestures. They glance at their phone and react with a bright laugh, eyebrows rising, eyes squinting, and lips parting in amusement. They lean closer to the table, gesture lightly with one hand, and tilt their head while engaging with something off-screen. Moving reflections from cars and passing lights play across their features, keeping the scene vivid and lively, while their hair remains clean and controlled.
