A person walks slowly through a modern museum space with high ceilings and soft natural light. The camera tracks their upper body from the side as they stroll past large, minimal art pieces, occasionally stopping to tilt their head and look at one. Their fitted jacket and relaxed slacks move gently with each step. Their hairstyle is well-maintained and their face shows subtle, shifting expressions â€” curiosity, appreciation, calm. A clean, matte finish on their skin complements the controlled lighting of the environment.
